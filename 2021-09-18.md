# What I've learned while migrating my sites to HTTPS with HTTP/2.

[Original](https://kadyrov.dev/2021/09/18/migrating-to-https-with-http2/)

Yes, I know that it is a too late decision and I need to do it 2-3 years ago.
But everyone did mistakes in his (or her) life. It is the same for me.

I started 2 weeks ago with upgrading Debian 8 to Debian 9 and all extra
packages (MariaDB, PHP, Ruby, OpenSSL, etc.). After that, I realized that
I'm done because I had HTTPS certificates on my websites which worked well.
It looked like it was enough. But it doesn't – I forget about HTTP/2.

TLDR: The problem that I had was about reinstalling nginx with the new
version of OpenSSL (1.1.0l). And I forget to upgrade nginx... Damn!

## A few words about mistakes...

Today I decided to spend all my time migrating my websites to HTTP/2.
By the way, I want to get A+ rating on SSLLabs for all websites.

I spent about 3-4 hours validating nginx's configs.

Then I tried to down all websites except one because I thought that the
problem is common for all websites (all of them have the same configs)
and I don't want to update all configs at the same time.

On every change, I checked results with SSLLabs trying to get A+ score.
And nothing happened – site returns responses via HTTP/1.1, not HTTP2,
and SSLLabs displayed just A score, not A+.

## What did I do?

I used curl to check HTTP response:

```sh
curl -vso /dev/null --http2 https://domain.tld
```

Every time curl returns me the same result:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Then I decided to check the installed version of OpenSSL:

```sh
# apt list --installed | grep openssl
openssl/oldoldstable,now 1.1.0l-1~deb9u3 amd64 [installed]
```

Okay, I've got the latest version.

Then checked which version of OpenSSL nginx uses. It must be the same
in the nginx's version output:

```sh
# nginx -V
built with OpenSSL 1.1.0l  10 Sep 2019 # Right here
```

Nice! I forget to reinstall nginx. I just reinstalled all required nginx's
packages and got curl response with HTTP/2!

```
< HTTP/2 200
```

Now I want to get A+ score on SSLLabs. Don't ask me why, I don't know.

## How to get A+ score

The next step is to create directory for dhparam and generate cert with OpenSSL.

```sh
# mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
# openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 4096
```

Then I changed SSL settings in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2; # I removed another protocols to get A+ score.
```

And in each server section for websites' configs I added:

```
listen 443 ssl http2; # <- Do not forget to add `http2`

server_name domain.tld;

ssl_certificate     /root/.acme.sh/domain.tld/fullchain.cer;
ssl_certificate_key /root/.acme.sh/domain.tld/domain.tld.key;

ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;

ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem; # <- It is required to get A+.

ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;

# Add HSTS to get extra points:
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
```

That's it!

After all changes and restarting nginx, I've had A+ in SSLLabs and HTTP2 response!

## Conclusion

Do not forget to check versions of installed packages. It does matter.
